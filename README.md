# IndiaMart Hackathon

This hackathon was conducted by Indiamart team where a prototype to remove data outliers needed to be built.
The project was built using Pandas dataframe and IQR to get the range required. 

I have used a configuration file for using the contractions across a unit which eventually helps to cluster the same units. 
Same meaning of units for example, kg, kilogram, kilograms etc. the prototype need to understand that which units are same.
